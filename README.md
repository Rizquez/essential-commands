# Essential Commands

A *living* collection of *reference sheets* with the essential commands I use every day (and add to as needed).

* 🧩 **Git** → [`README.git.md`](./README.git.md)
* 🐳 **Docker** → [`README.docker.md`](./README.docker.md)

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is intended to be a quick, clear, and practical reference for:

- Remember common command syntax without having to look it up every time.
- Maintain a personal knowledge base, but in a reusable format.
- Avoid errors, when a command or its description is modified, it is validated against official documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a comprehensive manual, but rather a summary of frequently used and useful commands.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Commands are added as real needs arise.

## 📖 Additional documentation

All commands added are based on the official documentation for both `Git` and `Docker`.

- [Docker CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker)
